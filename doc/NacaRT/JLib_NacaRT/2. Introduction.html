<h1><a name="2.Introduction-Designconstraints"></a>Design constraints</h1>

<p>Various requirements were mandatory during design and implentation phases:</p>

<p>NacaRT is a library layer used to executed Cobol-transcoded applications within a Java environment. Cobol programs are automatically transcoded in java source files with a syntaxe named cobol-like.</p>

<p>These transcoded programs have a strict source structure which is not executable by itself, but requires a important abstraction layer. NacaRT implements all required objets to fully the Cobol-Like syntax, and then be able to executed these programs in the same manner as the original Cobol code.</p>

<h3><a name="2.Introduction-TypesofsupportedCobolprograms"></a>Types of supported Cobol programs</h3>

<p>There are multiple types of supported Cobol programs. They must all respect IBM Mainframe hosts Cobol (<b><em>version to precised</em></b>) specifications.</p>

<h3><a name="2.Introduction-Syntaxandeasymaintenance"></a>Syntax and easy maintenance</h3>

<p>&#45; Automatic transcoding with full Cobol + CICS extension support.<br/>
&#45; Cobol like syntax as close as possible of original cobol syntax. In particular, it was mostly important to keep the same hierarchical&nbsp;description of the variables as in Cobol. No hard variable memory position computing was allowed. However,&nbsp;the important area of user interface management has been completly modernized, and defers in a important manner from the original CICS handling. But this transformation is automatically handled by the transcoder. This gives the developper a much high abstraction level of it's screen management.<br/>
&#45; All cobol variable types had to be fully supported, including packed decimal, binary variables, alphanumeric types, numeric edited types.<br/>
&#45; Ebcdic encoding had to be optinally supported for DB and File I/O.<br/>
&#45; All standard cobol keywords had to be fully supported, with the same semantics&nbsp;and border effects.<br/>
&#45; The notion of parapgraph, section, perform and goto had to be fully supported. The implentations details had to be hidden from the point of view of the application developper.<br/>
&#45; The Cobol-like source code files had to be widely checked by Java compiler. This means that no strings could to be used for variable ou paragraph identification for example, as there semantic could not be validated by the java compiler.</p>

<h3><a name="2.Introduction-Performance"></a>Performance</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;aim the the project is to execute entreprise-wide applications with&nbsp;the same magnitude of response time as the original mainframe. Many optimisations strategies have been used to achieve this important point. they will be explained below.
